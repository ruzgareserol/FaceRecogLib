# FaceRecogLib
A library for face detection and recognition.
The program uses opencv's haarcascade face filters and hog generation algorythims.
Ä°t is recomended to use this library while creating a database of people to recognise
The project will be further implemented to a real-time face recognition program that uses nvidia's cuda repository.
ust type the names untill it's done, then type "done"
it is recomended to use ubuntu 16.04 with this project. 
The project requires a built in opencv library
My directories are not static therefore any implementation has to be processed via-hard code in any python IDE-environment
The project works succesfully
Questions can be directed to ruzgareserols3(at)gmail.com

IMPORTANT
create three folders in desktop called" ImageData , iSeeYou and FacesOfPeople "
after creating these directories it will be much more easier for the program to find and access to certain files.

Handler is the main class that handles the database and image processing
  just type the names untill it's done, then type "done"
